Naming conventions are not super readable rn
File Structure is not very clear
Massive clue in Ento (our rostering system)
 - The roster object is the whole roster for the date range (1 week).
 - Each roster has days and shifts included
 - https://au.ento.com/roster-builder/#/view/xxxxxx/rostering/normal/role?modeRef=base
 -Roster-builder is the parent, roster is the object

Slop?

Modules seem to be a little all over the show. If I had built from scratch
I would make it more like MVC from Le Wagon examples.
CLEANUP -
 - Put arguements in to parentheses for methods that are missing it
 - added pry-byebug to gemfile

Structure:


Roster:
        [
          date: [shifts{
            morning: [nurses],
            evening: [nurses],
            night: [nurses]
            }
          ]
          date: [shifts{
            morning: [nurses],
            evening: [nurses],
            night: [nurses]
            }
          ]
          date: [shifts{
            morning: [nurses],
            evening: [nurses],
            night: [nurses]
            }
          ]
        ]
